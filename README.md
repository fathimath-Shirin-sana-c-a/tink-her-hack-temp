### Project Description
PeriodCare is a web-based menstrual health assistant developed using Flask and Python. It predicts upcoming period dates and ovulation cycles, provides personalized phase-based health tips, tracks symptoms with guided advice, manages essential product stock through a checklist system, and includes a structured full-day planner for period days.


### The Problem statement
Many students and young women face difficulty in accurately predicting their menstrual cycle, managing period symptoms, and staying prepared with essential products. Most existing applications are either complex, paid, or require personal data and login access.
There is a need for a simple, lightweight, privacy-friendly web application that helps users understand their menstrual cycle, manage symptoms, and plan their daily routine effectively.
### The Solution
PeriodCare is a simple, lightweight, and privacy-friendly web application developed using Flask and Python to assist users in understanding and managing their menstrual health effectively.
The system works by allowing users to enter their last period date and average cycle length. Based on this input, the application calculates and predicts:
The next expected period date
The estimated ovulation date
The fertile window range
The current menstrual phase
Beyond prediction, PeriodCare enhances user support by providing phase-based health guidance. Depending on the calculated cycle phase (Period, Follicular, Ovulation, or Luteal), the system displays personalized health tips to encourage better physical and emotional well-being.
To further support users, the application includes a symptom tracking module. Users can select common symptoms such as cramps, mood swings, headache, or bloating. The system then generates specific care suggestions and practical self-care instructions tailored to the selected symptoms.
Additionally, PeriodCare provides a Product Stock Checklist feature that helps users ensure they are prepared with essential menstrual products. If any required item is missing, the system alerts the user, promoting better preparedness.
The application also includes a Full-Day Period Planner, which offers a structured daily routine for period days. This planner suggests rest periods, hydration reminders, light activity guidance, and self-care recommendations to help users manage their day comfortably and efficiently.
Overall, PeriodCare acts as a digital menstrual companion that combines prediction, health guidance, symptom management, preparedness tracking, and daily planning — all within a simple and easy-to-use web interface.
